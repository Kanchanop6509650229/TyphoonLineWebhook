    B --> C[DeepSeek API]
    B --> D[Redis Cache]
    B --> E[MySQL Database]
    B --> F[Background Scheduler]
    
    subgraph "Core Components"
        G[Session Manager]
        H[Token Counter]
        I[Risk Assessment]
        J[Database Manager]
        K[Rate Limiter]
    end
```

### Technology Stack Analysis
- **Backend Framework**: Flask (Good choice for small-medium scale)
- **Database**: MySQL with connection pooling (Adequate)
- **Cache**: Redis (Excellent choice)
- **External APIs**: LINE Messaging API, DeepSeek API
- **Async Processing**: Custom AsyncDeepseekClient
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler

## Critical Weaknesses & Issues

### 1. Database Performance Issues

#### Current Problems
- **Inefficient Connection Management**: Default pool size of 10 connections may be insufficient under load
- **No Query Optimization**: Missing database indexes for frequently accessed columns
- **Synchronous Database Operations**: All database operations are blocking
- **Limited Connection Pool Configuration**: No connection timeout or retry mechanisms

#### Performance Impact
- High latency during concurrent user sessions
- Database connection exhaustion under moderate load
- Blocking operations affecting overall response time

### 2. Memory Management Concerns

#### Token Counter Cache Issues
```python
# Current implementation has unbounded growth potential
class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int = 1000):  # Fixed size but no monitoring
```

#### Session Management Problems
- Redis session data grows without proper cleanup
- No memory pressure handling
- Conversation history can consume excessive memory

### 3. Error Handling Inconsistencies

#### Fragmented Error Management
- Multiple error handling patterns (decorators, try-catch, custom exceptions)
- Inconsistent error logging and user feedback
- No centralized error monitoring or alerting

#### Missing Circuit Breaker Pattern
- No protection against cascading failures
- External API failures can impact entire system
- No graceful degradation mechanisms

### 4. Security Vulnerabilities

#### Authentication Weaknesses
- Simple verification code system without rate limiting
- No brute force protection for registration codes
- Missing input validation and sanitization

#### Data Privacy Concerns
- User context stored indefinitely in Redis
- No data encryption at rest
- Limited access controls

### 5. Scalability Limitations

#### Single Instance Architecture
- No horizontal scaling capabilities
- All processing on single thread for most operations
- Scheduler runs on single instance only

#### Resource Bottlenecks
- Synchronous processing model
- No load balancing considerations
- Limited concurrent user handling

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Database Layer Enhancements

#### Implement Database Optimizations
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Current DB Layer] --> B[Optimized DB Layer]
    B --> C[Connection Pool Tuning]
    B --> D[Query Optimization]
    B --> E[Async Operations]
    B --> F[Read Replicas]
```

**Actionable Steps:**
- Increase connection pool size to 50-100 connections
- Add database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Implement connection health checks
- Add database query performance monitoring
- Consider read replicas for conversation history queries

#### Database Schema Improvements
```sql
-- Add missing indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_user_timestamp ON conversations(user_id, timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_risk_level ON conversations(risk_level);
CREATE INDEX idx_registration_created_at ON registration_codes(created_at);

-- Add partitioning for large tables
ALTER TABLE conversations PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(timestamp));
```
